### the_question

"Who influenced you most growing up?"

- Were you a George Bush fan girl growing up? Does the republican party make you wet.
- Maybe your dad influenced you significantly, which is why you're now a raving alcoholic with a porn problem.
- In my case, it was a lot of radio personalities. The Spoonman, aka Brian Carlton on Triple M. I guess in general, well spoken people and journalists.
