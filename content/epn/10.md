### the_question

What are you worth?

- Would you consider your worth in dollar amounts, what is your price?
- Maybe you think your life is priceless, or for example would you throw it away to protect those you love?
- How about in a slave scenario?
- Personally I can say that I'm literally worth nothing, as proved by the lack of tips on my online adult webcam account.
      
### the_topic

Gold Stars

- You remember when you were a kid and you were given those gold stars?
- I was that kid who was utterly obsessed.
- I had the most gold stars (to a point where it would no longer fit on the page)
- It's kind of like how children masturbate.
      
### the_viewermail

Noura from Mecca, Saudi Arabia

"Dear Julius (ohh, hello)"
"I'm currently going through a particularly nasty divorce. It's been really hard lately, and I was wondering if you'd be able to tell a joke to cheer me up."

- Uh, Noura I actually don't tell jokes. I'm very confused and quite frankly, very offended.
- I mean, no wonder you're going through a divorce, you absolute idiot.
- But what I can reccomend is that you get on the porn.
- Porn never hurt anyone.
