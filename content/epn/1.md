### the_intro


    
### the_question

What do you want to achieve today?

- What's your priority?

- And not crying. That's not true. Men don't cry, we just masturbate vigorously until we pass out.
-
    
### the_topic

What is this show about?

- Want to have fun
- Comedy/Motivational Podcast
- I want it to make you feel
- Marketing platform for my novel
    
### the_viewermail

Julius Reade from Melbourne, Australia.

"Hey Julius, loving the first show. Personal request, but I have a bit of a foot fetish. Would you be willing to suck my foot?"

Well Julius, usually I charge my clients for this kind of work. But just because I love you. Let's get that sock off.
