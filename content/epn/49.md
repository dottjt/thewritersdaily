### the_topic

Call Centre

- Coming out of uni I knew nothing about jobs. Like, literally nothing.
- So I applied for a heap of jobs and this call centre company got back.
- I remember it was a group interview.
- Anyway, it was selling government funded education over the phone. Cold calling like 300 people a day.
- Basically it was calling vulnerable people. Man, the company was completely full of scumbags. But man, you meet some really great sales people.
- Everyone was like chain smoking. There was this guy who had like meth teeth from drinking too much coke, who was also hitting on me mind you, he went postal and sent out a mass email to everyone.
- I lasted 5 weeks, it was seriously the most depressing and stressful job I've ever had.

"I'm thinking of becoming a pedophile, but I'm afraid of kids. What do you think I should do, I really don't feel like becoming an accountant instead."

- Well, accountants get paid well, but if you're really keen about having sex with kids then I guess you just have to do whatever's in that sick twisted heart of yours.
