### the_question

"Can you drive?"

- Do you have an addiction to the fast n' furious movies, because you can't get enough of the speed when you're zooming down the highway at a 1,000 miles per hour.
- Perhaps you're still a child and at most you can simulate how you'd like to drive in a wild car chase in grand theft auto 5. Of course, don't forget to run over granny on the side of the road, because chicks really dig that.
- I still don't have my licence, but I'm working on it! And yes, I can drive perfectly fine. I'm just afraid of failing the test, that's the only reason I haven't done it yet.
      
### the_topic

America

- I remember when I was a kid America was the undisputed world superpower. It was like, you don't F with America, because we have all the guns' stuff.
- This was basically from the 90s up until maybe around 2019? Maybe a bit earlier. Possibly 2020. But now it's kind of like, China is clearly just beating America at everything. And it's crazy because it's happening in real time.
- America of course as of 2020 is basically disintigrating. The country is pretty divided when it comes to politics. The riots. Coronavirus.
- Of course, I think I'll always be fond of America, because to this day, it is still the most influential modern culture to have ever existed. You know, movies. Music. Apple. Microsoft. McDonalds. KFC. All these huge corporate companies all come from the USA.
- I think in particular, suburban America. You know, having a massive house with a big yard is something which I envy. And everything is so much cheaper, and professional wages are so much higher.
- Also popularity. It's hard to be internationally popular unless if you are American.
- With that said, America is an overrated country. The food and produce is terrible (HFC). There's a culture of overworking. When you factor in healthcare and that kind of thing, living there is actually more expensive than other countries. There's an extreme history of violence.
- I also think within our lifetime we'll see America break up into it's own individual states.

Sofia Robinson from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.

"I suffer from a disease where my eyes will begin to bleed spontaneously and it's really been affecting my confidence lately. What should I do about my condition?"

- Personally I think it's really about just lowering your self-esteem to cope with the pain of having no confidence, and quite frankly I don't think it's low enough.
- I mean if you're not binge eating every night, then can you really say that you've hit rock bottom so you can turn to something like Christianity to help boost your spirit?
- I mean, listen. Do you even cut your wrists, because if not there are some great tutorials online that may help.
- But really, it just sounds like you're not truly committed to having low self-esteem. It's like you want to be happy and have hope that things are going to get better, and that's just not on.
- As for your eyes, I mean. At least you're not asian. Try having a slant, and you'll begin to understand the definition of confidence.
