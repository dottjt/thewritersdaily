### the_question

When was the last time you calld your mother?

- In my case, I don't speak to my mother anymore. (cold hard bitch)
- But if you love your mum, give her a call.
- Dad too. (In my case, I don't even know if he's alive or not) [play fail sound]
      
### the_topic

Spotify.

- Talk about music streaming, how it's become a thing.
- Talk about the old days of pirating.
- Gee imagine the days of cd's and vinyls.
- Much like Joe Rogan $100 million deal, I will also be arranging a deal with them.
      
### the_viewermail

Dipesh from Chennai Pakistan (HA see what I did there?)

"Hey Julius, you hunk o' spunk."

"I suffer from severe case of bitchitis. You seee like a confident young man. How can I be less of a bitch?"

- (mock him) - if it isn't fuckin' lil bitch.
- If you want to be less of a bitch, you basically need to shut the fuck up and stop being such a pussy. Grab a gun. Shoot some strangers. Go crazy!
- But I tell you what doesn't make you a bitch? Listening to the writer's daily.
