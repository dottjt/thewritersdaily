### the_question

What worries you most about the future?

- Does everything make you worried? Does nothing make you worried?
- Are you one of those anxiety queens?
- As a stubborn male, very little worries me.
- I often just don't care and I assume nothing bad will happen or come of it.
      
### the_topic

Podcasting

- I thought I'd talk about my relationship with podcasting.
- I've been doing podcasting and radio since I was 16. (talk about why you love it.)
- (talk about some of the shows you've done)
- Actually, it probably started when I was a lot younger annd I'd just record myself speaking.
- I love entertaining people and making them laugh.
- Problem is that it doesn't pay well. So it's a side thing and that's also what makes it great. (lack of pressure etc.)
      
### the_viewermail

Jackson Young from Kushiro, Japan.

"I am from Japan. I like sushi very much. Sushi sushi sushi. It is better than the hamburger. Imperial Japan will rise and destroy you Western scum. HAHAHAHAHA"

- That was uh, well thank you first of all for sending that in.
- You know, I think you have a point there. Western people are scum.
- (I can't believe I've been lied to this whole time!)
- And to commemorate the fact I will be playing the Japanese national anthem, while touching myself sensually.
- Oh man, it's just making my clit vibrate.
