### the_question

What do you enjoy most about your day?

- Maybe you enjoy that morning coffee, along with a hand-rolled cigarette.
- Maybe it's just doing what it is that you love doing? Playing video games, working.
- For me it's just the process of seeing myself grow and progress. Weight lifting and just pushing myself.
- To see that I'm just a bit further along with my life than I was before.
- It helps create a sense of hope.
