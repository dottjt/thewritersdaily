### the_question

"Which generation are you from?"

- Are you a baby boomer, cashed up to your eyeballs in undeserved wealth? Keen on purchasing your 20th investment property.
- Perhaps you're one of those Gen X'er, and you absolutely hate everything about the world that which you live in.
- I'm personally a millennial. Which means I'm obsessed with myself, as well engaging in new experience, such as a five man bukkake.
      
### the_topic

Basketball

- I played basketball from like prep to grade one.
- I remember some teacher coming into the classroom and being like, who would like to sign up for the basketball team and I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it,
- I wasn't very good. I think I only ever scored once, ever. I was the kid who passed the ball on the sidelines, that was basically my role. And my mum would get angry at me because I wasn't like a main scorer.
- I remember our very first year we never scored and always got destroyed. Then I think like the very last game, this guy finally scored.
- I also remeber there was this massive kid, and I full on ran into him and knocked him down.
- My mum made a promise that I would get a packet of pokemon cards if I could score. And I did, and I got a shiny Zapdos!
- It really was the only time I ever properly did sport. I think like starting grade 3, I started going to weekend tutoring, so that basically became my sport.
