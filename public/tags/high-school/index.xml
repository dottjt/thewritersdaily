      <description>the_question How much time do you spend on social media each day?
 Are you just obsessed with Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re like me where you have social media, but you just unfollow everyone and you just chat to people? I like to use social media as like a news platform. Especially Reddit. But I would say I&amp;rsquo;m average. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d like to spend less time on social media?</description>
