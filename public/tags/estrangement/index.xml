      <description>the_question What do you enjoy most about your day?
 Maybe you enjoy that morning coffee, along with a hand-rolled cigarette. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just doing what it is that you love doing? Playing video games, working. For me it&amp;rsquo;s just the process of seeing myself grow and progress. Weight lifting and just pushing myself. To see that I&amp;rsquo;m just a bit further along with my life than I was before. It helps create a sense of hope.</description>
