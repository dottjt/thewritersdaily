<p>Weed</p>
<ul>
<li>I remember I 1st smoked weed when I was 18 or 19.</li>
<li>Then it progressively became a habit and throughout uni, I was getting blazed pretty often.</li>
<li>For like the 1st year of uni it was like, once a week.</li>
<li>(watch music videos and play video games)</li>
<li>And then I started hanging out with a bad crowd (not so much because of weed, but because I was depressed)</li>
<li>Then one day I was hanging with the lads and I just stopped enjoying it.</li>
<li>Nowadays I&rsquo;m basically 100% sober. I don&rsquo;t drink, I don&rsquo;t smoke weed.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to have solid routine as well as be stoned.</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Hey Julius. You sexy beast. How much sand is too much sand?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, everyone knows you can never have too much sand?</li>
<li>Fact is, I like a sandy pussy. It&rsquo;s like having sex with the ocean. You get that nice breeze.</li>
<li>I even sometimes like to use the beach as my personal fleshlight.</li>
<li>Sand is also great for building walls, in particular to keep immigrants out of this fine country.</li>
<li>Not because I&rsquo;m a racist, because because I&rsquo;m a race realist.</li>
