<ul>
<li>Growing up I had really bad handwriting. (attritious)</li>
<li>It was like if you ate alphabet spaghetti and then vomitted everywhere.</li>
<li>Then I was like 20 I decided that I was going to learn it from scratch.</li>
<li>Then I thought, what if I used it to pick up women on the internet.</li>
<li>One time I wrote a note this girl in the library. &ldquo;Your beauty is like fireworks to my eyes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s stages. It looks nice, then you begin adding your own twists and styles to it, and now it&rsquo;s all fancy but is barely legible.</li>
<li>But yeah, I just find it really soothing as well.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Hey Julius, loving the podcast. Even though I&rsquo;m from Indonesia and I don&rsquo;t understand a lick of English, I still think it&rsquo;s pretty great when you go crazy and put everyone down. My question is, what can I do to learn English, so I can actually understand your show?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>As any sane person knows, reality TV is the foundation of western society. So you really should be binge watching that.</li>
<li>Most porn thankfully is in English as well, so that&rsquo;s good. Which means you&rsquo;re also staying away from that wierd Japanese porn shit, which is also good for your soul.</li>
<li>Conversation practice is obviously important as well, which is why mugging people in English, is a great way to spark conversation.</li>
<li>You know, some people are a bit at first, but when you bring your knife out, that&rsquo;s when they really begin talking.</li>
